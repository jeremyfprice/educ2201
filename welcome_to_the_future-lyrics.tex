\poemtitle{Welcome to the Future}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{When we were going on an eight hour drive}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
When I was ten years old\\
I remember thinking how cool it would be\\
When we were going on an eight hour drive\\
If I could just watch TV\\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
And I'd have given anything\\
To have my own PacMan game at home\\
I used to have to get a ride down to the arcade\\
Now I've got it on my phone\\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
[Chorus]\\
He-e-ey\\
Glory glory hallelujah\\
Welcome to the future\\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
[Verse 2]\\
My grandpa was in World War II\\
He fought against the Japanese\\
He wrote a hundred letters to my grandma\\
Mailed them from his base in the Philippines\\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I wish they could see this now\\
Where they say this change can go\\
Cause I was on a video chat this morning\\
With a company in Tokyo\\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
[Chorus]\\
He-e-ey\\
Every day is a revolution\\
Welcome to the future\\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
He-e-ey\\
Look around it's all so clear\\
He-e-ey\\
Wherever we would go and well we\\
He-e-ey\\
So many things I never thought I'd see\\
Happening right in front of me\\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
[Verse 3]\\
I had a friend in school\\
Running-back on a football team\\
They burned a cross in his front yard\\
For asking out the home-coming queen\\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
I thought about him today\\
Everybody who's seen what he's seen\\
From a woman on a bus\\
To a man with a dream\\
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
[Chorus]\\
He-e-ey\\
Wake up Martin Luther\\
Welcome to the future\\
He-e-ey\\
Glory glory hallelujah\\
Welcome to the future\\
\end{verse}
